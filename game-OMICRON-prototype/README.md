A 2D platformer prototype that I developed where players control a ball. The ball's behaviour is a direct physical simulation, with forces calculated using actual electromagnetic field equations. Players can toggle the ball's charge, influencing its attraction or repulsion to platforms. Gamepad controls are supported.
