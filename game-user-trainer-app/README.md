A game I developed for a printer management software company, designed to train users in an engaging 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'-style format.

The game features an intricate scoring system, providing players with immediate feedback after each response. The user interface is enriched with a myriad animations, ensuring seamless transitions and interactions. Another standout feature is the Earth representation, which dynamically alters colors to depict CO2 levels, influenced by player choices.

Given a tight two-week development window and my unfamiliarity with traditional Unity animation tools at the time, every visual element, from the interactive interface to every single element that moves, was animated purely through code. This approach not only ensured timely completion but also posed a unique and rewarding challenge for myself.

While the client supplied the game's textual content, the entire implementation was my creation from the ground up.
