A game I developed for a printer management software company, designed to train users in an engaging 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'-style format.

The game features an intricate scoring system, providing players with immediate feedback after each response. The user interface is enriched with a myriad of animations, ensuring seamless transitions and interactions. Another standout feature is the Earth's representation, which [dynamically alters colors to depict CO2 levels](Assets/Scripts/CO2LightSystem.cs), influenced by player choices.

Given a tight two-week development window and my unfamiliarity with traditional Unity animation tools at the time, every visual element in the interface was [animated entirely through code](Assets/Scripts/GameController.cs). This approach not only ensured timely completion but also posed a unique and rewarding challenge for myself.

While the client supplied the rules and the game's textual content, the entire implementation was my creation from the ground up.
