<size=25><b>The situation</b></size>

<size=19>You have just been enrolled as the MPS Manager of a company that has 2,000 printers and copiers in contracts.

Your boss, the owner of the company, has invested no less than 1.5 million in total to create this business 2 years ago (including the wages of 6 employees). He has seen no return on investment so far. So he challenges you to prove that MPS can be profitable.

He has given you 6 months; else he will sell the contracts and abandon the MPS business.

On your first day in the company you set up a meeting with your 5 team members. You ask them the following questions:

<size=20><b>· What are our most profitable contracts?
· What % of cartridges do get lost?
· How much time we ship in advance?</b></size>

Your team gives you a blank stare. They don’t have such information. They use a monitoring tool to collect the counters to bill. But they do not use the toner alerts from that tool because it constantly duplicates them.

You then call your old friend Paul who recommends you to acquire Nubeprint:  the only MPS tool that manages the performance of MPS contracts automatically. 
--
<size=19>Today is 1st March 2016, 2 months since you installed Nubeprint.

You meet again your team and ask the same questions. They now come with on-line <i>reports</i>.
 
Your objective is to use the information available to take decisions to make your MPS contracts profitable. 

You have a limited time to analyze each situation and take one decision. Each decision has medium term effect on profit.
