The margin that you calculate in your contract is just the desired margin. This margin will only happen if the amount of pages the customer prints with each cartridge is exactly what you considered for your contract. In real life, this never happens: you duplicate shipments, the customer installs when the level is at 20%... During the contract management process, you must ensure that each cartridge prints at least the desired number of pages. Your decision will have a negative impact on your margin.

You have noticed that your customers are replacing the cartridge too early. So the easiest and quickest way to reduce this is by shipping at the right moment of time: the closest to the moment in which the cartridge is empty. So you program your Nubeprint system to trigger the shipment notifications based on “days remaining”, instead of “% remaining”. Your decision has a short term positive impact on your margin.

You have noticed that your customers are replacing the cartridge too early. So you think the best way to stop this behavior is by educating them. This is a huge task to which you dedicate all resources during a limited period of time. Unfortunately, after 3 to 4 weeks the user would forget. There is a better way to automatically reduce the potential waste: by shipping the closest to the moment in which the cartridge is empty. Your decision will have a limited positive impact on your margin.
