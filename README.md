[Full demo on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH0LfCJr0ig)

An advanced multiplatform 2D game demo centered around ability-based mechanics, showcasing a variety of sophisticated underlying systems such as: custom touch controls, an automated level builder, numerous code-animated graphical effects, etc.

## USER TRAINER GAME
### Developed for a printer management software company to train their users

A game I developed for a printer management software company, designed to train users in a fun, 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'-style format. Due to the tight one-week development timeframe, there wasn't an opportunity to delve into traditional Unity animation tools. However, leveraging my abilities at the time, every visual element—from the interactive interface to the dynamic score displays—was animated purely through code. This approach not only met the deadline but also made the project an interesting challenge for myself.

## OMICRON
### A 2D platformer based on electromagnetism's physics
<img src="readme-assets/omicron.gif" width="200"/>

A 2D platformer prototype where players control a ball. The ball's behaviour is a direct physical simulation, with forces calculated using actual electromagnetic field equations. Players can toggle the ball's charge, influencing its attraction or repulsion to platforms. Gamepad controls are supported.

## JENGA 
### A prototype to understand materials

[Full demo on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvYWhK3wTY4)

A prototype I built to play around with Unity physics and materials. This implementation features an automatic tower builder, utilising Unity's physics engine to simulate block interactions. Designed for experimentation with different material adjustments to fine-tune block behaviour to test the stability of different configurations.

## FPS Mechanics Sandbox

 A prototype I built to delve into first-person shooter dynamics: experimentation with first-person view controls and camera, foundational AI for enemy interactions, and raycasting-based shooting mechanics.
