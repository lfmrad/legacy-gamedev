A game I developed for a printer management software company, designed to train users in a fun, 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'-style format. Due to the tight one-week development timeframe, there wasn't an opportunity to delve into traditional Unity animation tools. However, leveraging my abitities at the time, every visual element—from the interactive interface to the dynamic score displays—was animated purely through code. This approach not only met the deadline but also made the project an interesting challenge for myself.

## OMICRON
### A 2D PLATFORMER BASED ON ELECTROMAGNETISM'S PHYSICS.

A 2D platformer prototype where players control a ball. The ball's behavior is a direct physical simulation, with forces calculated using actual electromagnetic field equations. Players can toggle the ball's charge, influencing its attraction or repulsion to platforms. Gamepad controls are supported.

[Full demo on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvYWhK3wTY4)

A prototype I built to play around with Unity physics and materials. This implementation features an automatic tower builder, utilizing Unity's physics engine to simulate block interactions. Designed for experimentation with different material adjustments to fine-tune block behavior to test the stability of different configurations.

## FPS Mechanics Sandbox
